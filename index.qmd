## Bio

I am an Associate Professor in the School of Computing at [KAIST](http://cs.kaist.ac.kr) and a member of the [Computer Architecture and Systems Lab](https://casyslab.kaist.ac.kr/) (CASYS). My research focuses on the intersection of systems and AI, with particular emphasis on building efficient and scalable infrastructure for large-scale AI workloads. My research interests span AI systems (LLM serving, GPU computing), memory systems (disaggregation, CXL, PIM), operating systems (kernel optimization, virtualization, security), storage systems (file systems, databases, SSD), and computer architecture (CPU/GPU offloading, SmartNIC).

I received my PhD in Computer Science and have been recognized with best paper awards at ACM SOSP'24, SOSP'21, and USENIX ATC'18. My work has been acknowledged through the KAIST EWON Endowed Chair Professorship (2021), Google Research Scholar Award (2025), and multiple KAIST breakthrough recognitions (2023, 2025).

My group has published extensively at top-tier systems conferences including SOSP, OSDI, EUROSYS, and USENIX ATC/FAST/SECURITY.

## Internship

### 2025 Winter Internship (겨울학기 인턴십)

I am always looking for talented graduate students interested in systems research. If you are not a KAIST student, please first apply to KAIST CS ([Korean application](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=41) / [English application](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=41)).

I am also looking for undergraduate students (currently KAIST students only) for fun and impactful research projects.

**Research areas in our lab:**

-   Systems for AI (LLM serving, GPU systems, memory disaggregation)
-   Operating Systems (kernel optimization, virtualization, security)
-   Storage Systems (file systems, databases, SSD optimization)
-   Computer Architecture (CPU/GPU offloading, PIM, SmartNIC)

**To apply:** Please email me at yjkwon at kaist.ac.kr with your CV, transcript, research interests, and available start date. More details on our [Internship page](internship.qmd).
