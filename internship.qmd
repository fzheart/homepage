## 2025 Winter Internship (겨울학기 인턴십)

I am actively looking for talented students to join our research group. We work on exciting problems at the intersection of systems and AI, with focus on building efficient infrastructure for large-scale AI workloads.

### Research Areas

Our lab focuses on the following research areas:

* **Systems for AI**: LLM serving and inference optimization, GPU systems, memory disaggregation, KV cache management
* **Memory Systems**: CXL-based memory pooling, memory deduplication, PIM architectures
* **Operating Systems**: Kernel-level optimization, virtualization, OS security, concurrency bug detection
* **Storage Systems**: File systems for AI workloads, database systems, SSD optimization
* **Computer Architecture**: CPU/GPU offloading, SmartNIC acceleration, hardware-software co-design

### For Graduate Students

**International applicants**: If you are not currently a KAIST student, please first apply to the KAIST CS graduate program:

* [Korean application guide (한국어 안내)](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=41)
* [English application guide](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/content?menu=41)

Once admitted to KAIST, please contact me to discuss research opportunities.

**KAIST students**: If you are already a KAIST graduate student, please email me directly with your CV and research interests.

### For Undergraduate Students

**Current opportunity**: KAIST undergraduate students only

I am looking for motivated undergraduate students who want to gain research experience through hands-on projects. These projects often lead to publications at top-tier conferences and can serve as excellent preparation for graduate school.

**What we look for:**

* Strong programming skills (C/C++, Python)
* Solid understanding of computer systems fundamentals
* Enthusiasm for learning and tackling challenging problems
* Ability to work independently and in a team

### How to Apply

Please email me at **yjkwon at kaist.ac.kr** with:

1. **CV/Resume** - Include your academic background, relevant coursework, and any research or project experience
2. **Transcript** - Unofficial is fine for initial contact
3. **Research interests** - What specific areas interest you? What problems do you want to work on?
4. **Availability** - When can you start? How many hours per week can you commit?

For undergraduate students, also include a brief statement about your career goals and why you're interested in research.

### What to Expect

**For graduate students:**

* Work on cutting-edge research problems
* Publish at top-tier systems conferences (SOSP, OSDI, EUROSYS, etc.)
* Collaborate with leading researchers in the field
* Access to high-performance computing resources
* Opportunity to work on impactful real-world systems

**For undergraduate students:**

* Hands-on experience with real research projects
* Mentorship from PhD students and faculty
* Opportunity to co-author research papers
* Preparation for graduate school applications
* Flexible hours that work with your course schedule

### Lab Culture

We believe in:

* **Rigorous research** with real-world impact
* **Collaborative environment** where everyone learns from each other
* **Work-life balance** - research is a marathon, not a sprint
* **Open communication** - regular lab meetings, paper readings, and discussions
* **Diversity and inclusion** - we welcome students from all backgrounds

### FAQ

**Q: What programming languages do I need to know?**  
A: Strong C/C++ skills are essential for systems research. Python is useful for scripting and data analysis. Experience with Rust is a plus but not required.

**Q: Do I need prior research experience?**  
A: Not required, but helpful. We value enthusiasm and willingness to learn over prior experience.

**Q: Can international students join as interns before admission?**  
A: Unfortunately, due to visa regulations, you must first be admitted to KAIST as a graduate student.

**Q: What is the time commitment?**  
A: For undergraduates, typically 10-15 hours per week during semester, more during breaks. For graduate students, research is your primary focus.
