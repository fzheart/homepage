I teach courses on operating systems and virtualization at both undergraduate and graduate levels at KAIST. My teaching focuses on providing students with deep understanding of system internals and hands-on experience with real-world systems.

## Current Courses

### CS330: Operating Systems and Labs

An undergraduate course covering fundamental concepts of operating systems including processes, threads, synchronization, memory management, file systems, and I/O systems. The course includes extensive lab components where students implement key OS mechanisms.

## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in teaching through a combination of rigorous theoretical understanding and hands-on practical experience. My courses emphasize:

* **Deep conceptual understanding** of system internals
* **Hands-on implementation** of key mechanisms
* **Reading and discussing** influential research papers
* **Real-world relevance** through industry case studies
* **Critical thinking** about design tradeoffs

## Awards

* **Soo-Young Lee Teaching Innovation Award** (2021) - Awarded by KAIST for excellence in teaching innovation

## Guest Lectures

I occasionally give guest lectures on systems research and my group's work. If you are interested in having me speak at your institution, please [contact me](mailto:yjkwon@kaist.ac.kr).
